# DevMsAss
The repository for developping microservices and the interface.

## Microservices
* Authentication : We can login and logout of our application with this microservice.

## Interface
We are implementing an interface using **React Router** powered by **Vite**. It is in the folder `vite-project` where we have :
* `routes/login.jsx` : Login page.
* `routes/dashboard.jsx` : Logout page.
* `error-page.jsx` : 404 error page.
* `main.jsx` : Router.

To launch the application : `npm run dev`.
